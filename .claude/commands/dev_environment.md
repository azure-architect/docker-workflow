# Development Environment Setup

I'll help you create a complete development environment using Docker containers on your remote server (192.168.0.135:2375). This automated setup will configure networking, volumes, and services based on your project requirements.

## Supported Environment Types

### 1. Node.js Full Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Vue/Angular development server
- **Backend**: Node.js API with hot reload
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions/caching
- **Proxy**: Nginx for routing and static files

### 2. Python Development
- **Application**: Python with Flask/Django/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and task queues
- **Worker**: Celery for background tasks
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks

### 3. Full-Stack Web Application
- **Frontend**: Static file server or SPA development
- **API**: RESTful backend service
- **Database**: Choice of SQL or NoSQL database
- **Cache**: Redis for performance
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx for production-like setup

### 4. Microservices Development
- **API Gateway**: Nginx or Traefik
- **Services**: Multiple backend services
- **Database**: Service-specific databases
- **Message Queue**: Redis or RabbitMQ
- **Service Discovery**: Container networking

### 5. Data Science Environment
- **Jupyter**: Notebook server with data science libraries
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for computation caching
- **Visualization**: Grafana for dashboards

## Setup Process

When you choose an environment, I will:

1. **Analyze Your Project**
   - Detect existing configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Identify framework and dependencies
   - Determine appropriate base images

2. **Create Docker Configuration**
   - Generate docker-compose.yml for the environment
   - Configure networking between services
   - Set up volume mounts for code persistence
   - Configure environment variables

3. **Deploy Environment**
   - Pull required Docker images
   - Create and start all containers
   - Configure service connections
   - Verify all services are running

4. **Provide Access Information**
   - List all service URLs and ports
   - Provide connection strings for databases
   - Share useful commands for development

## Development Features

- **Hot Reload**: Code changes automatically reflected in containers
- **Database Persistence**: Data volumes survive container restarts
- **Network Isolation**: Services communicate through Docker networks
- **Environment Variables**: Easy configuration management
- **Health Checks**: Monitor service availability
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging for debugging

## Example Environments

### Quick Start Commands
- "Set up a Node.js API with MongoDB and Redis"
- "Create a Python Flask app with PostgreSQL"
- "I need a React frontend with a Python backend"
- "Set up a data science environment with Jupyter"
- "Create a microservices environment for my project"

### Custom Requirements
- "I have a Laravel project that needs MySQL and Redis"
- "Set up Elasticsearch with Kibana for log analysis"
- "I need a development environment for a Go microservice"

## Project Integration

I can integrate with your existing project by:
- Reading your current configuration files
- Mounting your source code into containers
- Setting up appropriate build processes
- Configuring development tools and debuggers
