I'll restore the project context by analyzing the development pipeline, key transcripts, and current state. Please follow these steps:

1. First, I'll perform a comprehensive context restoration:
   - Analyze the current pipeline state (1-planned through 5-archived)
   - Review recent session transcripts and summaries
   - Examine the project structure and key files
   - Build a mental model of the project's current state

2. I'll gather critical contextual information:
   - Active tasks in the pipeline and their current stages
   - Recent implementation decisions and their rationale
   - Outstanding issues or challenges
   - Overall project architecture and dependencies
   - Code patterns and conventions in use

3. I'll create a detailed context report including:
   - Current project state summary
   - Active development tracks
   - Recent changes and decisions
   - Pending tasks and their priorities
   - Key technical concepts specific to this project

4. I'll identify any context gaps that need clarification
